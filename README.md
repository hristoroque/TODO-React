# TODO-React
A TODO App made in React. I am developing this app to learn the basics of React. It's a more complex todo app that records time with pomodoros and has a built-in timer to help you stay concentrated.

The functionalities of the app are the following:

- [ ] Records the name of tasks to do that day
- [ ] Has the option to set a number of pomodoros to any task
- [ ] You can start a timer in a task to record the time spent
- [ ] You can delete any task
- [ ] You can edit any task
- [ ] It records the total time spent
- [ ] It records the total time planned
- [ ] The task will be deleted once it runs out of pomodoros
